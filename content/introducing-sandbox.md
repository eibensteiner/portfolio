title: Introducing Sandbox
---

Iâ€™m excited to announce **Sandbox**. An **auto-generated open source design system** tailored to the needs of small organizations.

Building a design system with Sandbox couldn't be easier. Clone the project, paste your `tailwind.config.js` in the root, and that's it.

## Problem & Vision

I often see the **problem of keeping design systems up to date**. Especially in smaller organizations we want to keep the design system **as small and tidy** but also **as powerful as possible** for our use cases.

Sandbox is trying to tackle this issue. It **auto-generates your design system out of your design tokens** just by adding one simple file everybody works with.

## Rolling out

Sandbox is **currently in development** and not public. The MVP will include auto-generated **typography, color & resources pages**. Components and more will follow.
