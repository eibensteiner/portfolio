title: Introducing Sandbox
---

Iâ€™m excited to announce *Sandbox*. An *auto-generated open source design system* tailored to the needs of small organizations.

Building a design system with Sandbox couldn't be easier. Clone the project, paste your `tailwind.config.js` in the root, and that's it.

## Problem & Vision

I often see the *problem of keeping design systems up to date*. Especially in smaller organizations we want to keep the design system *as small and tidy* but also *as powerful as possible* for our use cases.

Sandbox is trying to tackle this issue. It *auto-generates your design system out of your design tokens* just by adding one simple file everybody works with.

## Rolling out

Sandbox is *currently in development* and not public. The MVP will include auto-generated *typography, color & resources pages*. Components and more will follow.
