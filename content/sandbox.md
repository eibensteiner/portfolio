Iâ€™m excited to announce **Sandbox**. Sidebox is an **auto-generated open source design system** tailored to the needs of small organizations.

Building a Sandbox for your company or project couldn't be easier. Checkout a new branch, paste your `tailwind.config.js` in the root, and that's it.

### Vision

Design Systems should support both developers and designers in their everyday work and shouldn't be an additional time consumer. After all, it is a mostly internal used software to **simplify the communication between several different parties** in an organization.

However, I often see the **problem of keeping design systems up to date**. Especially in smaller organizations we want to keep the design system **as small and tidy** but also **as powerful as possible** for our use cases.

Sandbox is trying to tackle this issue. It **auto-generates your design system out of your design tokens** just by adding one simple file everybody works with.

### Rolling out

Sandbox is **currently in development** and not public. The MVP will include auto-generated **typography, color & resources pages**. Components and more will follow.
