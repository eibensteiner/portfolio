I’m excited to announce Command. A completely redesigned way of navigating and exploring websites and digital products, crafted by <a class="font-medium text-gray-900 hover:text-gray-600 transition cursor-pointer">@internetztube</a> and me in the past few weeks.

### Usability as a Plugin

By hitting a predefined keyboard shortcut like <badge :text="'⌘ K'"></badge>, Command appears as an overlay for your product or website. It contains a list of the most important features of the website and is 100% useable via keyboard.

These so-called commands are hierarchically structured, can be filtered by search terms and are even executable by it’s very own keyboard shortcuts. Globally.

### Fully Customizable

Designers and Developers want their product to look custom and we are hearing you. Comand is fully adaptable and comes without any styling out of the box.

### Rolling out

Command is currently in development and not public, but things are looking good, to release it soon as Vue.js and Web Component in the rollout phase. Other Frameworks will be considered based on it’s interest.
