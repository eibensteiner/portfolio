title: About me & my Story
---

Hey there, I'm Dominik, a tinkerer and maker from Linz, Austria.

I'm always striving for simple solutions to complex problems as well as minimalism and visual clarity.

While product design is the core of my expertise, I also have a broad knowledge in frontend development and branding. With a special focus on early-stage startups.

## What does tinkerer & maker mean?
Job titles change. And our industry is messed up in terms of them. I'm usually calling myself that way because it actually described my previous roles quite good.

I always acted as the bridge between design and frontend with the overall market situation and appearance in mind.

## What's your favourite work environment?
I like working in early-stage startups, as mentioned above, because of it's fast-paced environments.

Teams should be small, connected and highly independent (Which is very important for me as a design-minded and entrepreneurial person).

## Which languages do you speak?
German and English. In school I also learned spanish for a few years in school but wouldn't add that to the other two languages.

## Are you currently available for hiring?
I'm currently happily employed, but feel free to drop me a line if you got an exciting opportunity we could talk about.

## How is this website built?
**Nuxt.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Netlify**, **Splitbee** and several plugins were used when building this page. You can take a closer look at it on the [GitHub repository]().

## Do you have any hobbies besides Design?
I love to travel (especially to northern europe) and spend time with my girlfriend, family and friends. Other hobbies are tech, branding and photography.

## What's your current stack?
On the hardware side I'm currently using a iMac (2017) in my home-office setup and a MacBook Pro (2019) with two Samsung U28E590D when working in the HQ.

I also use an iPad Pro (2020) for sketching and my AirPods Pro to take a deep dive into my work.

On the software side I would like to mention the following essentials:

- **Figma** - Probably the app I spent the most time in.
- **Notion** - I'm pretty much organizing my whole life in Notion
- **Spotify** - My music app of choice
- **iA Writer** - Writing longer texts. Everything else is done in Notion
- **VS Code** - The ecosystem and performance of VS Code is unbeatable
- **Cleanshot** - Screenrecording and Screenshot-taking tool for MacOs

## How can I reach out?
If you have any questions or inquiries, you can drop me a line on me@dominik.email or on Twitter.

## Did you go to university?
Yes I studied Communication & Knowledge Media at the UAS Upper Austria, where I set my personal focus on product design and frontend development. In 2018 I completed the studies with a BA (1.5).
