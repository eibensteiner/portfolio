title: About me & my Story
---

I've been planning this post for a long time, but struggled to find a topic to begin with.

## Could you introduce yourself in one sentence?

I'm **Dominik**, **26 years old** and currently living and working in **Linz** as a **Product & Brand Designer** for [Blockpit]().

## How is this website built?

This website was built using **Nuxt.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Netlify**, **Splitbee** and several plugins. You can find a list of them in the [GitHub repository]().

## Which languages do you speak?

German as my mother tongue and english in my daily business. In school I also had 4 years Spanish, but I can't remember anything.

## What does Coding Designer mean?

Job titles change. And our industry is messed up in terms of them. I'm usually calling myself that way because it actually described my previous roles quite good. I always acted as the bridge between design and frontend.

I built prototypes, made screendesigns and implemented them, but if someone asks me to decide on one I would choose design over and over again.

## What's your favourite work environment?

Highly entrepreneurial team members and fast paced. A clear focus on a well designed brand and product. And someday I would really like to work on either a productivity tool or a developer tool.

## Do you have any hobbies besides Design?

I love to travel (especially to northern europe) and spend time with my girlfriend, family and friends. Other hobbies are tech, branding and photography.

## What tools do you use on a daily base?

Safari, Slack, Figma, Notion, Spotify, iA Writer, VS Code and Cleanshot are essential ones.

- **Safari** - I like the privacy approach and the perfect integration in the Apple ecosystem.
- **Figma** - Probably the app I spent the most time in.
- **Notion** - I'm pretty much organizing my whole life in Notion
- **Spotify** - My music app of choice
- **iA Writer** - Writing longer texts. Everything else is done in Notion
- **VS Code** - The ecosystem and performance of VS Code is unbeatable
- **Cleanshot** - Screenrecording and Screenshot-taking tool for MacOs

## How can I reach out?

If you have any questions or inquiries, you can drop me a line on me@dominik.email or on Twitter.

## Did you go to university?

Yes I studied Communication & Knowledge Media at the UAS Upper Austria, where I set my personal focus on product design and frontend development. In 2018 I completed the studies with a BA (1.5).
