Hey there, I'm Dominik and I'm currently living and working in #stahlstadt, #linz, #austria.

After my A-levels I wanted to follow my passion for technology and design by studying Communication & Knowledge Media at the UAS Upper Austria , where I set my personal focus on **product design** and **frontend development**. In 2018 I completed the studies with a **BA (1.5)**.

Friends and colleagues would probably describe me as a **multidisciplinary designer** with a high interest in **designOps** and **frontend development**.

Besides design I love to **travel** (especially to northern europe) and **tinker on my own projects**.
