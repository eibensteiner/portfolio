title: Me & the Internet
---

I'm a *creative* and I ever have been since i can think of myself. My grandma is still telling me (all the time) how impressed she were of my drawing skills I already had when I was 4 or so.

And nevertheless, I am not capable of describing her what I am doing today.

Maybe it's because she doesn't understand anything about the internet and the businesses that came with it.

But most probably it's difficult because I see myself as a *generalist by heart* with interests in fields like *art, business, psychology and engineering*.
