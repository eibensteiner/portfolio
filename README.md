# Portfolio
My portfolio is currently under development, but it's built with the following stack:
* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) – I love the simplicity and extensibility of Vue.js.
* [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org) – Nuxt.js is a Framework built on top of Vue.js.


## Local development
To try it live install all dependencies first with
```sh
$ yarn install
```
Afterwards you can run it locally with
```sh
$ yarn dev
```
